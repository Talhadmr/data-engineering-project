## Data Engineering Project

Welcome to DE World! 



## Let's get started

This repo contains a Docker Compose. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Talhadmr/data-engineering-project
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd data-engineering-project
```

Rename `dev.env` to simply `.env`â€” this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it _will_ contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container

```bash
sudo make
```

Now, navigate to http://localhost: in your browser! Voila! You're ready to get started with the project.
